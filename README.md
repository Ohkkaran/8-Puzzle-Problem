# 8-Puzzle-Problem
The 8-puzzle problem is a classic example of a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid containing 8 numbered tiles (from 1 to 8) and one blank space. The objective is to arrange the tiles in a specific goal configuration by sliding the tiles into the blank space, one move at a time.
